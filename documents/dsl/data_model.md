# [Index](./../index.md) - Data Model DSL

## Introduction
The purpose of the dsl is to:

1. Define Entities  - the core object that defines a data structure and everything related to that
2. Attributes       - the fields that contain the data and their types, and configuration
3. Validation       - how the entity is evaluated for being correct
4. Triggers         - side effects that happen when a entity value changes
